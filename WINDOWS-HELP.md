# Windows Guide

The commands in the workshop have been primarily designed for *nix machines. However the workshop should still work on a Windows machine with a few minor changes covered in this guide.

## Prerequisites:

1. [Install Cygwin and include vim as an option](https://www.cygwin.com/)

## Using the Maven Wrapper

In the guide when the maven warpper is used:

```
./mvn
```

Substitute `./mvn` with `./mvnw.cmd`.
